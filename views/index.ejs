            <h2>Hi, I'm Tess Levinson!</h2>
            <p>As a researcher and educator, I'm focused on how STEM learning can offer connection and empowerment for children, youth, and educators. I work with community organizations to create and evaluate contextually relevant coding and robotics programs for young children.</p>
            <p>I just completed my PhD in Applied Developmental and Educational Psychology with the <a href="https://sites.bc.edu/devtech" target="_blank">DevTech Research Group at Boston College</a>. My doctoral research included partnerships with organizations including Horizons for Homeless Children in Boston, Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow (MEET) in Jerusalem, the Technion University in Israel, and the Varkey Foundation in Argentina.</p>
            <p>As a design-based researcher, my work includes early childhood and elementary curriculum design, teacher professional development, program evaluation, and qualitative and quantitative research. In addition to my research, I develop informal education and camp programs at the intersection of community issues and STEM practices.
