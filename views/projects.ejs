        <h2>CAL KIBO @ Horizons (Homelessness project)</h2>
        <p>The CAL-KIBO @ Horizons for Homeless Children project has been a multi-year collaboration to develop and explore the impacts of a robotics program at a multilingual preschool for children experiencing homelessness. For my PhD work, I have been coordinating the project and researching the impact of the program on children and teachers.

        <h2>Play, Academics, and Coding (Dissertation)</h2>
        <p>My dissertation research focuses on kindergarten teachers' beliefs about play, formal academic learning, and school-readiness as the teachers implement a playful computer science curricula in the United States and Argentina. </p>

        <h2>MEET-KIBO (Jerusalem Project)</h2>
        <p>The MEET-KIBO program was a collaboration between the DevTech Research Group, Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow, and the International Jerusalem YMCA to explore how coding and robotics can serve as a bridge across ages, nationalities, and languages. For this project, we supported Israeli and Palestinian teenagers in designing and teaching a robotics program for a bilingual kindergarten classroom. <a href="https://sites.bc.edu/devtech/research/coding-as-a-bridge" target="_blank">Learn more about the project here.</a></p>

        <h2>Early Childhood CS for Children with Disabilities</h2>
        <p>Individuals with disabilities are underrepresented in STEM and CS fields, but my research has shown that computer science and robotics can serve as an opportunity for success for children with disabilities. You can read about this work in my book chapter, co-authored with Dr. Ziva Hassenfeld at Brandeis and Libby Hunt.</p>

        <h2>CAL International (International Collaborations + Evaluations)</h2>
        <p>The Coding as Another Language [link to CAL website] curricula for ScratchJr and KIBO Robotics are play-based curricula for prekindergarten through second grade integrating computer science and literacy, and have been used and researched around the world. I was on the writing team for the curricula, and collaborated on international research and evaluations with The Technion in Israel and Varkey Foundation in Argentina. We presented on the CAL international collaborations at the International Society of the Learning Sciences conference in 2023, and you can read more about the collaborations in the proceedings here: LINK.</p>

        <h2>STEM + Social Justice Education</h2>
        <p>In addition to my research work, I develop informal education and camp programs at the intersection of community issues and STEM practices. This has included a two-week program on the connection between social justice and STEM for rising eleventh grade students at the URJ Six-Points Sci Tech Academy, and a youth research program at the Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism.</p>
